# Company Forms Showcase

Multiple HTML form used in web development — in one project. Pure HTML, no CSS, no JavaScript.

## Business Context

All 10 forms are built around a Belgian tech company. Every form solves a real problem that companies face — from searching for employees, to booking meeting rooms, to submitting documents. I built this project not just code for the sake of code — each form has a reason to exist.
